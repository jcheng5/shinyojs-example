title: "Visualizing 1 million points with OJS + Shiny"
code-tools: true
server: shiny
---

This example visualizes 1 million x/y points using 2D binning. The user can choose the number of bins.

This version uses client-side OJS to provide an input slider and the visualization, but uses server-side Shiny code to provide the data and perform the binning. Combining OJS and Shiny in this way gives us huge gains in efficiency and performance.

```{ojs}
viewof bins = Inputs.range([10, 100], {value: 10, step: 1, label: "Bins"})
```

```{ojs}
Plot.plot({
  width: 600,
  height: 600,
  color: {
    scheme: "blues"
  },
  marks: [
    Plot.rect(transpose(rects), {x1: "x1", x2: "x2", y1: "y1", y2: "y2", fill: "z"})
  ]
})
```

```{r}
#| context: server-start
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

points <- read_csv("points.csv", col_types = "dd")

cache <- cachem::cache_disk("./cache")
checksum <- digest::digest(points, "sha1")

# Quick and dirty 2D binning implementation
bin2d <- function(x, y, breaks = 30) {
  stopifnot(length(x) == length(y))
  
  # Create cut points for the x dimension's bins
  xbreaks <- seq.int(min(x), max(x), length.out = breaks)
  # Put each x coordinate in a bin
  xbin <- cut(x, breaks = xbreaks, include.lowest = TRUE)
  
  # Now the same for y
  ybreaks <- seq.int(min(y), max(y), length.out = breaks)
  ybin <- cut(y, breaks = ybreaks, include.lowest = TRUE)
  
  # Count the number of x/y points in each 2D bin; result is a matrix
  binned <- table(xbin, ybin)

  # Convert to the data frame format that Observable Plot expects.
  # Note that the order of arguments to expand.grid matters; the
  # results need to line up with the matrix when it's turned into a vector
  cbind(
    expand.grid(x1 = head(xbreaks, -1), y1 = head(ybreaks, -1)),
    expand.grid(x2 = tail(xbreaks, -1), y2 = tail(ybreaks, -1)),
    z = as.vector(binned)
  )
}
```

```{r}
#| context: server
bins_debounced <- reactive(req(input$bins)) %>% debounce(125)

df <- reactive({
  # p <- ggplot(points, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  #   stat_bin2d(bins = bins_debounced())
  # binned <- ggplot_build(p)$data[[1]]
  # binned %>% select(x1 = xmin, x2 = xmax, y1 = ymin, y2 = ymax, z = count)
  
  bin2d(points$x, points$y, bins_debounced())
})# %>% bindCache(bins_debounced(), checksum, cache = cache)

ojs_define(rects = df)
```
